# zuse_covid_ode
 
This repository contains the script for the challenge in covid_zuse_code_ib.ipynb as a jupyter notebook, which is accompanied with explanations and sources. The data that I used for comparison is in the file fallzahlen.csv. The source of the data is https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Fallzahlen_Kum_Tab.html.
